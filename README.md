# Horiseonseo

Changed the title so it would display company name "Horiseon" this helps with google search visibility. 

Added alt attributes to the images for improved performance for screen readers. 

Consolidated some elements in css the images and h2 headings in the content div. Since this areas share all the same attributes and this will make it easier to keep them uniform going forward.

Got rid of the span seo class in the h1 heading. Typically webpages should only have one h1 heading so having a unique class seemed unnecessary. Also it was in the middle of the word and looked confusing. Also added a href=/ to allow user to get back to the homepage when they click on it. 

Changed the div into a nav and the div header into just header to keep the html simple, adjusted the css stylesheet accordingly. 

Condensed css code that was split up by more individualized classes and doing the same thing under a larger div class. example. cost management, brand awareness, and lead generations all under benefits. This allows for changes to be made to effect all them at the same time keeping them uniform

Moved the font family 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif that appeared throughout css and made it the default font family for the page
